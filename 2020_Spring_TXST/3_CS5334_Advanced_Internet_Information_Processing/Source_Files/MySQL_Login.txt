-- How to connect
        Use a MySQL client , these are installed on zeus.cs.txstate.edu or eros.cs.txstate.edu
    The MySQL client can also be downloaded from https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=www.mysql.com&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdior_x%40txstate.edu%7C57daa48273aa4b387c9308d7a3407eb1%7Cb19c134a14c94d4caf65c420f94c8cbb%7C0%7C0%7C637157369709728965&amp;sdata=0KVRDOSib%2FBmEiM%2Fo7XH%2BxuttCVgyVsfzwVBwQHk1QE%3D&amp;reserved=0.

        To connect to MySQL type at command prompt(Windows) or shell prompt(Linux)
        mysql -u <username> -h mysql.cs.txstate.edu -p
        This will prompt you for a password, enter it
        You can change the password using
        SET PASSWORD = PASSWORD('newpassword');

        There is a database created using your username
        After logging in you will be presented with the following prompt
        mysql>
        type "use z_x3"
        This will  open your databas and you can create tables in this database.
        The tables you create will be accesed as <username>.<tablename>

-- Accessing MySQL from the web browser
        phpMyAdmin is a web interface that lets you connect to your MySQL accounts and
        also run queries and do other SQL related stuff.
        goto https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmysql.cs.txstate.edu&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cdior_x%40txstate.edu%7C57daa48273aa4b387c9308d7a3407eb1%7Cb19c134a14c94d4caf65c420f94c8cbb%7C0%7C0%7C637157369709728965&amp;sdata=RAN%2BA2pP9%2FAvW3gM80xRKeBV3oCH8aoYMn5C8mpxr08%3D&amp;reserved=0

        type
                username=z_x3
                password=jFRCELSJP
        That should log you on
        Also when you login via phpMyAdmin the databases that you have permissions to access
        should show in the Drop Down list in the Left Frame. This interface then allows you to
        view your tables, run queries etc. Keep in mind this is a frontend to the MySQL database
        commands and not all commands and functions will work. So if the web interface does not
        work then switch back to the command line mode (MySQL prompt).
