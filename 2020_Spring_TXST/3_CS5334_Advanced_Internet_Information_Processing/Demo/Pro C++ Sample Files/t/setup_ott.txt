If this expected output is not obtained, please check your environment settings
for PATH, CLASSPATH, and LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

   * PATH should include the directory .../bin (location of ott)
   * PATH should include /usr/local/packages/jdk1.1.6/bin before /bin.
   * CLASSPATH should include the file .../sqlj/lib/translator.zip
   * CLASSPATH should include the file .../sqlj/lib/runtime.zip
     (If you use JDBC 8.1.7 you can also use use runtime11.zip or
      runtime12.zip, depending on your JDK version.)
   * CLASSPATH should include the file .../jdbc/lib/classes111.zip
   * CLASSPATH should include the file .../jdbc/lib/nls_charset11.zip
   * The location of the ocijdbc9 dynamic library (.so, or .dll, depending on 
     the platform) should be included in LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Solaris) or in 
     PATH (NT).  The location of libocijdbc9 is .../lib.

In addition, a JDK 1.1-compatible Java compiler (assumed to be javac) and the
java interpreter (assumed java) must be correctly installed.
